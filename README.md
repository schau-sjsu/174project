# A+ Planner

CS174 Final Project
Team: Blueducks

## Important Instructions

Our project is deployed at this link: https://main--a-plus-planner.netlify.app/login

In order for the client side to communicate with the server (where the php files are uploaded), the user must do the following:

* Connect to the SJSU VPN
  * This allows access to the php files on the school server. 
* Allow insecure requests on their browser. This is necessary because the school server uses http instead of https.
  * The user can click on the lock icon next to the browser URL. Then, navigate to the site settings or disable protections for that page. 

## Other Notes

This repository includes the client side source code (React application) that was deployed at the above listed link. For ease of access, the php files are also included in the "174-backend" directory, but the actual files that get called by the app are stored on the school server. Copies are just included for easy access. 

For more in depth explanations of the code, please see the report included in this project submission.
